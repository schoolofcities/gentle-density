all permits are correct as of June 23, 2024
permits are classified based on "Specific Use Category", hence the risk of undercounting is low
UPDATE: Sep 18, 2024 - description of permits are reviewed to weed out those that are purely for improvements of existing sec suites/laneway hse
UPDATE: Oct 10, 2024 - addition of two new data sets to reparate between pure secondary suites and lock-off units in Vancouver
