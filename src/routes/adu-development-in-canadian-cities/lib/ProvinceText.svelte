{#if selectedProvince === "British Columbia"}

	<p>
		British Columbia (B.C.) is Canada’s westernmost province, covering 0.92 million km2, and home to 5.65 million people. The province is experiencing a housing crisis: an estimated 23% of renters spend more than 30% of their net income on housing, and 42% spend more than 50% of their net income on housing (Vancouver Sun). The B.C. government has set <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/local-governments-and-housing/housing-targets" target="_blank">housing targets</a>, taking a phased approach to implementation with its municipal cohorts, and has already involved a first 20 municipalities (and issued a Housing Target Order for the next 10 that will participate). To combat the lack of affordable housing options, the Province created a new <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/housing-and-tenancy/tools-for-government/local-governments-and-housing/ssmuh_provincial_policy_manual.pdf" target="_blank">Provincial Policy Manual & Site Standards</a> for small-scale, multi-unit housing that includes secondary suites, ADUs, triplexes, townhomes, and multiplexes. The Province intends to encourage more housing options for low- to middle-income families, and for aging parents and adult children or other family members, to, for example, help pay a mortgage, invest in existing property, and contribute to more long-term rental housing in communities.
				 
	</p>
	<p>
		Secondary suites under B.C. legislation are defined as “an independent living unit with its own kitchen, sleeping area, and washroom facilities contained within another dwelling.” An ADU is defined as “a self-contained dwelling unit, such as a garden suite, laneway home, carriage house, or garage suite, located on the same legal lot as another dwelling.” All policies and procedures for the construction of a secondary suite or ADU can be found in the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/housing-and-tenancy/building-or-renovating/secondary-suites/home-suite-home-2023-sept-6.pdf" target="_blank">Home Suite Home: Guidelines</a>.
				
	</p>
	<p>
		Funding for secondary suites and ADUs is attainable through the <a href="https://www.bchousing.org/housing-assistance/secondary-suite" target="_blank">Secondary Suite Incentive Program (SSIP)</a> for homeowners. The SSIP provides financial assistance to homeowners who wish to build long-term affordable rental units. Homeowners can receive up to 50% on the cost of renovations, to a maximum of $40,000. Money is provided through a rebate for the loan that does not have to be repaid if the homeowner adheres to the terms of the program.

{:else if selectedProvince === "Alberta"}

	<p>
		Alberta is the fourth largest province in Canada, covering 0.66 million km2 , and has a population of 4.85 million (2024). The province registered the largest net inflow of interprovincial migrants in Canada in 2024.

	</p>
	<p>
		Alberta takes pride in the fact that families have access to lower housing costs, with a home costing “as little as” $450,000. Nonetheless, almost 500,000 people spend more than 30% of their income on housing. According to Alberta’s ten-year strategy to improve and expand affordable housing, its social and affordable housing represents 3.1% of the total housing stock, which is below the national average.
				
	</p>
	<p>
		According to Alberta’s  <a href="https://ebs.safetycodes.ab.ca/documents/webdocs/PI/safety-tips_secondary-suites_april2021.pdf" target="_blank">Secondary Suites Standards</a>, a secondary suite is defined as “a self-contained dwelling unit that is part of a house containing not more than two dwelling units (including the secondary suite).” A secondary suite may have more than one storey and be either on the same level, above, or below the principal dwelling. Permitted secondary suites include single-detached houses, semi-detached houses, and freehold row houses. Secondary suites are also permitted where they are provided in part of a building; they must also include a kitchen, bathroom, and separate entrance, and have an independent heating and ventilation system, as per the National Building Code. The Province makes it clear that each municipality has different land use bylaws concerning secondary suites and if a resident wishes to build, they should consult their local bylaws.
				
	</p>
	<p>
		Funding for secondary suites is administered by individual municipalities, but the Province does have an <a href="https://www.alberta.ca/affordable-housing-partnership-program#jumplinks-1" target="_blank">Affordable Housing Partnership Program</a>. The program allows nonprofit and public and private sector housing providers to apply for funding. Under construction type eligibility, it allows for an addition to or renovation of existing housing; demolition and new construction resulting in a minimum five net new affordable housing units; conversion of non-rental housing (e.g. hotel or commercial space); and redevelopment on the existing site involving demolition and new construction.
				  
	</p>

{:else if selectedProvince === "Saskatchewan"}

	<p>
		Saskatchewan is a central Canadian province with a population of 1.13 million (2021 Census). It is the fourth largest province, with an area of 577,060 km2. More than half the population lives outside the four largest cities, widely dispersed in remote, rural, and northern communities. Since 2021, the availability of rental units in the private market has decreased as the population has increased to record highs and opportunities for home ownership have tightened with rising interest rates.
	</p>
	<p>
		Saskatchewan Housing Corporation (SHC) is a Treasury Board Crown Corporation responsible for housing policy, programs, and services. In 2019, SHC entered into a ten-year, cost-matched funding agreement with the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) under the National Housing Strategy. The Saskatchewan Housing Action Plan 2022–2025 suggests that more than 41,800 households continue to be in core housing need, including seniors and Indigenous households. The Province will invest approximately $585 million of provincial and federal funding over ten years to protect, renew, and expand community housing and support its priorities related to housing repair, construction, and affordability.  
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="https://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/taxes-and-investments/tax-credits/saskatchewan-secondary-suite-incentive-grant-program" target="_blank">Saskatchewan Secondary Suite Incentive Grant Program</a> is designed to increase the availability of rental units in local communities, improve housing affordability, and generate supplementary income for homeowners. The program will provide 35% of the total cost to construct a new secondary suite in an owner’s primary residence (or a laneway home, garden suite, or garage suite), to a maximum of $35,000 for a qualifying suite. The program comes with eligibility criteria and timelines.

{:else if selectedProvince === "Manitoba"}

	<p>
		Manitoba is one of Canada’s Prairie provinces, with a population of 1.34 million people across 540,310 km2, making it the fifth-largest province in the country. In the last decade, international immigration has strongly contributed to Manitoba’s population growth, which is likely to continue to have a strong influence on rental housing demand, as recent arrivals tend to rent before buying a home.
				 
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="http://www.manitoba.mb.ca/housing/index.html" target="_blank">Manitoba Housing</a> is a Crown Corporation created in 1967. Its mandate is to enhance the affordability of, and accessibility to, adequate housing for Manitobans, particularly those of low- to moderate-income or who have specialized needs; maintain and improve the condition of existing housing stock; ensure there is an adequate supply of housing stock; and stimulate the activities of the housing market to benefit Manitobans as a whole.
		
 
	</p>
	<p>
		Since 2010, the Province has been encouraging the construction of secondary suites, or “granny suites” in homes to deal with the province's housing needs and help build healthy, vibrant communities. The Province describes secondary suites as “in essence, a rental apartment located on a property that would normally accommodate only a single-family home.” Although undocumented, a high number of illegal, do-it-yourself secondary suites are suspected to exist in municipalities throughout Manitoba; the construction of legal secondary suites through municipal development and permitting processes has not been common. This could be explained, in part, by the lack of specific policies and regulations in most of the municipal development plans and zoning bylaws. To combat this problem, the Province issued the <a href="https://www.manitoba.ca/mr/land_use_dev/pubs/mpgss.pdf" target="_blank">Municipal Planning Guidelines for Secondary Suites</a> in 2013 to encourage municipalities to allow secondary suites by adopting a less restrictive stance toward their development.
				 
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2010, Manitoba Housing offered financial assistance to eligible homeowners through a forgivable loan covering 50% of construction or renovation costs, up to $35,000 per suite. The <a href="https://legacy.winnipeg.ca/ppd/PublicEngagement/HousingSpeakerSeries/documents/SecondarySuites-ProvincialFundingProgram.pdf" target="_blank">applications</a> are available only on request from Manitoba Housing. [Note: At this time, it is unclear if the program is still active or has been replaced.]

{:else if selectedProvince === "Ontario"}

	<p>
		Ontario is the second largest province in Canada, covering about 0.89 million km2, and is the most populous, with 14.22 million people (2021 Census). It is one of the fastest growing places in North America, with a projected increase of 43.6% between 2022 and 2046, or 6.6 million people. Within the province, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) will see the largest increase in population.
		
	</p>
	<p>
		Ontario is home to 44.1% of all Canadian households that are in core housing need (a measure of housing affordability, suitability and adequacy), the highest in the country. Ontario receives about 39% of its funding from the federal government, has set a goal of building at least 1.5 million new homes by 2031, and is committed to meeting this goal in part by promoting denser development near transit and reforming zoning to create more “gentle density.” The Province set housing targets for its 50 largest municipalities through its Building Faster Fund, a $1.2 billion fund that provides up to $400 million per year to reward municipalities that have achieved at least 80% of their annual target, with a bonus to those exceeding their annual goals.
		    
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2022, the Province issued Bill 23, The More Homes Built Faster Act, as a next step of its plan to address the housing crisis by building 1.5 million homes over the next ten years. The Bill was significant in allowing three units to be built on one lot, and removing parking minimums, among other incentives. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2023, Ontario recorded 9,879 ADU starts. To encourage their development, the Province maintains a dedicated <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/add-second-unit-your-house" target="_blank">webpage</a> describing the relevant regulations. Under the Ontario Renovates Secondary Suites Forgivable Loan Program, homeowners can apply for a forgivable loan of up to $25,000 and receive an additional grant of $5,000 if accessible modifications are included in the project. The provincial <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/so-1997-c-27/latest/so-1997-c-27.html" target="_blank">Development Charges Act of 1997</a> also requires municipalities to reduce development charges for ADUs, intended to encourage the creation of more affordable housing options. The Province makes it clear that each municipality has different land use bylaws concerning secondary suites and if a resident wishes to build, they should consult their local bylaws.

{:else if selectedProvince === "New Brunswick"}

	<p>
		New Brunswick is one of Canada’s eastern provinces, located in the Maritimes. It is Canada’s only officially bilingual province, with a population of 775,610 (2021) and land area of over 70,000 km2. Since 2014, and particularly since 2019, the province has experienced record population growth after years of decline and stagnation.   
	</p>
	<p>
		The Province recognizes changing housing preferences, the lack of supply to meet demand, and labour shortages and market pressures as factors that influence the housing situation. In 2023, through a series of stakeholder consultations, the Province released a strategy, Housing for All, that promises to create the conditions to develop 6,000 new homes per year. 
		</p>

		Under <a href="https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/services/services_renderer.19576.Housing_Assistance_for_Persons_with_Disabilities.html" target="_blank">Housing Assistance for Persons with Disabilities</a>, the Province offers loans to homeowners who want to modify their property by building a secondary suite or garden suite for adult persons with disabilities. A forgivable loan is provided to eligible applicants, up to a maximum of $36,000. The applicant is required to produce equity or provide proof of other sources of financing to cover the cost of creating a suite or an extension that exceeds the maximum forgivable loan available.
				 
	</p>

{:else if selectedProvince === "Nova Scotia"}

	<p>
		Nova Scotia is the second smallest province in Canada, covering about 55,284 km2, with a population of less than one million (2021). Recent significant growth has put pressure on the housing market, which is most prominent in Halifax Regional Municipality but also having an impact on all regions of the province. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The 2022 Provincial Housing Needs Assessment Report estimated that given various key indicators, including demographic predictions, the province has a current gap between housing supply and demand of 27,300 units, which is expected to grow to 71,600 units by 2027. In October 2023, the government released its five-year housing plan, Our Homes, Action for Housing. The plan represents a projected $1 billion investment, and highlights targets to create the conditions for more than 40,000 new housing units across the province. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Nova Scotia defines secondary suites and backyard suites as “self-contained dwelling units located within or on the same property as an existing house (or main dwelling unit)” and are registered under the same title. Piloted in 2023, the Province has made an $8 million investment over three years for its <a href="https://beta.novascotia.ca/documents/secondary-and-backyard-suite-incentive-program-guidelines" target="_blank">Secondary and Backyard Suite Incentive Program</a>. The program offers financial incentives to eligible homeowners who plan to build a housing unit in or on the property of their primary residence. Homeowners may receive up to 50% of the eligible project costs, to a maximum of $40,000, and those that continue to live in their primary residence and meet tenant eligibility requirements over the five-year term of the loan do not need to repay the loan. As of April 2024, the Province had received more than 500 inquiries about the program, received 48 applications, and approved 25 forgivable loans. The homeowner and tenant eligibility criteria, eligible costs, and process are outlined in this <a href="https://beta.novascotia.ca/sites/default/files/documents/1-3589/secondary-and-backyard-suite-incentive-program-guide-en.pdf" target="_blank">guide</a>. .
